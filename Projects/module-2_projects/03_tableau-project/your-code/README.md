## Personal Summary

Choosing a dataset was the first and maby also the hardest step - an ocean of options and a growing amount of data to check...
After digging through the growing data jungle, I finally landed on the Pokemon Dataset.
I had NO idea whatsoever about Pokemons, and never heard about Pokemon-Generations - but it felt like a colorful subject: that's something.
My first visualisations proved to be unreasonable - again and again inconsistencies came up and futher research indicated.

Finally I found this table: https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VI)
I made a text file copy ("pokemon.txt") and made all final visualisations with this data.

The structure of the tableau gives first an overview of all contents.
