    "Now that the company hired you, they are interested in evaluating whether the campaign was a success or not as they're planning on running a similar one again within the next couple of months. The challenge, however, is that you only have access to pageview data for the landing page. Company J has worked with a data consultancy in the past and they were able to provide some estimates with regards to conversions that you can find below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to guide you through working with vague requirements from stakeholders and only a handful of information. You start by taking a first look at the data to see if you can visually spot any meaningful variations. Following that, you are going to attempt to quantify the impact of the marketing campaign. Once you have some numbers, you will get access to a handful of additional data points that will support you in your conclusion. At the end, you will discuss your recommendation to the Marketing team with regards to the assumptions you had to make to get to your conclusion.\n",
