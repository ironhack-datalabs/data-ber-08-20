# Lab | Parsing API Data

## Introduction

This is a simple introduction to APIs with an open and available API: Coingecko API.
In this lab there are two main challenges. 
- First challenge: investigate the coingecko API documentation that shows you the complete workflow of querying data from their API and parsing them, and complete the small exercises in the "main.ipynb" file.
- Second challenge: follow the example from in the "your code" folder to develop your own api scrpaing that parse another set of data from the coingecko API.

## Getting Started

Open the `example.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Study it from top to bottom and test the codes in each cell to see the outputs. Make sure you understand everything.

Then open `main.ipynb`. You'll create your own API parsing program that works with the coingecko API.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
